# Change log

| Version |          Date           | Release | Soul                           |
| :-----: | :---------------------: | :-----: | ------------------------------ |
|   1.0   | <nobr>2026-03-12</nobr> |  3.4.0  | First release of NVMesh 3.4.0. |

# General

The main objective of the NVMesh 3.4.0 release is to provide some key resilience-related improvements. The release of the first functionally complete version of managed non-disruptive upgrade (mNDU) is the main enhancement.

See [Release Index](https://nvidia.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NSV/pages/2831793511/Release+index) for package details.

# Functionality

## Managed NDU Completion and Optimizations

[NVMESH-2557](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-2557) \- The scope of mNDU now includes upgrading management itself, the nvmesh-upgrader agents and the interopDB. The end-to-end upgrade is initiated by upgrading and restarting a single management. Then this upgraded management can be instructed to upgrade the rest of the cluster.

- For previous upgrade agents, i.e., prior to NVMesh 3.4.0, these will not be auto-upgraded, so the new version of the upgrader will have to be installed and restarted manually on all nodes running NVMesh.

[NVMESH-6594](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-6594) \- Multiple clients can now be upgraded concurrently, i.e., in parallel instead of one by one. In addition, mNDU does not stop on a single upgrade failure. Instead, it stops after some user-set number of failures.

## TOMA Field Resilience Improvements

A few options have been added to the `toma_rpc` application to facilitate overcoming field issues. These options were added as a means to overcome reversion of specific TOMA issues that have been fixed in the interim. Nevertheless, these options may be useful in certain unexpected scenarios instead of restarting TOMAs and thus provide SREs with additional optionality.

[NVMESH-7068](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7068) \- Addition of a `toma_rpc` command to instruct the local TOMA to stop being the leader. This is done as follows:

- `toma_rpc simulate reelect`

[NVMESH-7072](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7072) \- Addition of a `toma_rpc` command to instruct the TOMAs to resend all volume statuses to management to resynchronize them. The command can also be limited to a specific volume. This is done as follows:

- `toma_rpc simulate resend-praids-report all/<volume_name>`

## NVMesh Observability Enhancements

Multiple enhancements have been made to the NVMesh exporter as described in the EPIC, [NVMESH-5849](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-5849) providing enhanced observability for memory usage, VPG consumption, SERJIO usage and TOMA RAFT information.

Some `/proc` additions and changes have been implemented as part of these enhancements.

## REST API for Metadata Management

Prior to NVMesh 3.4.0, it was possible to insert arbitrary fields in volume definitions through REST CRUD operations. This was not limited, so it was possible to collide with fields used by management itself. To make this more robust, only management fields are allowed in the base volume object hereon. User-defined fields can only be set within the volume's metadata section, [NVMESH-5320](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-5320).

Volume metadata can also be managed via the CLI, [NVMESH-7010](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7010).

## Integrated OTEL Support

Integrated management support for OpenTelemetry (OTEL) traces has been added. It runs auto-instrumentation for several adjunct components, i.e., MongoDB, Kafka and NodeJS, which generate a significant amount of traces. NVMesh management itself generates a small amount of traces reporting on the the internal management queue length.

Integrated OTEL support is disabled by default and can be enabled via `management.js.conf` via the options in `config.openTelemetry`.

## CPU Pinning and "Noisy Neighbor" Reduction

NVMesh 3.4.0 introduces new options for pinning IO of specific volumes to specific CPU cores. This is useful for machines running multiple applications requiring different volumes that are CPU-core separated, e.g., when a volume is used only by a specific container or VM and it is pinned to specific CPU cores. In that case, it makes sense to pin the IO to that volume the same cores, [NVMESH-6156](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-6156).

**<u>Note:</u>** This is alpha level functionality and has not undergone any QA.

## Performance Improvements for Ethernet Multi-Rail Environments

In Ethernet multi-rail environments, many connection attempts will fail. Improvements were made to reduce the affect this has during error situations so that reconnection and IO resumption is significantly faster, [NVMESH-7778](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7778).

## Performance Improvement to Drive Formatting

Drive formatting time on multi-drive servers is improved by performing multiple formats in parallel, [NVMESH-7337](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7337).

## Monitoring Improvements

[NVMESH-6578](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-6578) \- Add /proc file for SERJIO status in JSON format.

[NVMESH-7067](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7067) \- Add /proc file for active TOMA mTLS certificate inspection.

[NVMESH-7696](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7696) \- Add /proc file for TOMA client subscribers count.

## NVMesh CSI Driver Update, version 1.9.1

This CSI Driver supports both this version of NVMesh and the following earlier versions: NVMesh 2.7.2-HF16+, NVMesh 3.3.1-HF7+ and NVMesh 3.3.2-HF3+.

### New Features

None.

### Bug Fixes

[NVMESH-6750](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-6750) \- Reorganize shutdown process with configurable pre-shutdown delay.

[NVMESH-6872](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-6872) \- Update system packages and urllib3 for security fixes.

[NVMESH-7590](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7590) \- CSI v1.9.0 incorrectly addresses clients by their K8s node name.

[NVMESH-7605](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7605) \- Parsing of the client's status.json output failed due to a change in a field's format leading to incorrect assertion of state.

Unticketed \- Fix a typo in a config field, `allowIncompatibleVersions`.

### Compatibility

- NVMesh 2.7.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.4.0
- Kubernetes 1.22 \- 1.34

# CLI Changes

## Command Changes

- **–description** added to **user** **create**/**update** and to **config-profile create**/**update** commands

## Alpha Features

The following features are considered Alpha and not intended for use by end-users:

- An alpha feature has been added enabling mass or bulk operations on objects using shell-style ranges such as “**volume create –name test-volumes-{prod,stage}-{0..100} …**”. The use case for this is primarily testing related. This should not be used for production operations.

- **upgrade-agent, upgrade, upgrade-step, component, release, platform** \- these are new commands related to NDU. These are partial implementations that are not qualified for production operations.

# Known Issues

| Ticket | Description | Workaround & Comments |
| --- | :-- | :-- |
| <nobr>[NVMESH‑7214](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7214)</nobr> | When performing mNDU from 3.3.2 to 3.4.0, the 3.3.2 management may still be accessible for a few minutes. | This could be considered as working as designed in practice. However, set the "Disable Old Management when in Upgrade Mode" to true before upgrading to avoid this. |
| <nobr>[NVMESH‑7269](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7269)</nobr> | The manual upgrade option appears as an option in the CLI, while in practice it will be rejected as an incorrect option by management. | The manual mode is not a product feature, rather used for debug. |
| <nobr>[NVMESH‑7676](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7676)</nobr> | When performing mNDU from 3.3.2 to 3.4.0, a management with 3.3.2 that is coming up and running sanity checks may encounter a KAFKA error. | The management performing the mNDU will still continue the upgrade including the failed management. |
| <nobr>[NVMESH‑7755](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7755)</nobr> | When mNDU is performed on a client that is encrypting a volume, that volume may remain attached in limbo on the client, in the atom state indefinitely. | Reboot the node to clean the state. |
| <nobr>[NVMESH‑7826](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7826)</nobr> | On nodes with IOMMU enabled, with some kernels and with some drives, unbinding and then binding a drive to an NVMe driver, either the built-in kernel one or NVMesh's driver, may cause corrupt memory writes. | This behavior is not related to NVMesh directly. <br><br> Kernels such as the following exhibit this behavior: <ul style="padding-left: 24px;"><li>`5.15.0-164-generic`</li> <li>`5.19.0-50-generic`</li> <li>`6.2.0-25-generic`</li></ul> <br><br> Newer kernels such as the following do not exhibit this behavior: <ul style="padding-left: 24px;"><li>`6.5.0-25-generic`</li><li>`6.8.0-100-generic`</li></ul> <br><br> Using strict IOMMU, i.e., setting the kernel command line parameter `iommu.strict=1`, prevents this, but affects performance significantly and so is not recommended. |

## Support Matrix Update

The updated NVMesh support matrix is available at [NVMesh Support Matrix](https://confluence.nvidia.com/display/NSV/NVMesh+Support+Matrix).

**<u>Note:</u>** Kernels from 6.8.0 up until 6.14.6 suffer from a kernel workqueue crash in ​​cma_netevent_work_handler, as described [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2363273). NVMesh is incompatible with these kernels ([NVMESH-6447](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-6447)) as is. The NVMesh team has inserted a patched version of the relevant non-NVMesh kernel modules to fix this issue and make NVMesh compatible.

# Pre-built Packages

All NVMesh 3.4.0 packages can be found in NVIDIA's artifactory [here](https://urm.nvidia.com/artifactory/sw-ngc-nvmesh-generic-local/3.4.0).

# Upgrade

Upgrading from this version to future versions will be best conducted using the mNDU feature, see above for more details.

Upgrading from versions prior to NVMesh 3.2.0-HF2 is not possible. Upgrading from 3.2.0-HF2 is with a cold upgrade. From NVMesh 3.3.0 and onwards, it is recommended to perform upgrades using mNDU. For these versions, hot upgrade is supported.

**<u>Note:</u>** [NVMESH-7874](https://jirasw.nvidia.com/browse/NVMESH-7874) - For Ubuntu 22.04 and above, it is required to disable automatic service restarts during package upgrades. Ubuntu uses a utility called `needrestart` that may trigger an automatic restart of NVMesh services during an `apt install` or `apt upgrade`. To prevent this for the NVMesh services, create the a configuration file named `/etc/needrestart/conf.d/needrestart_nvmesh.conf` with the following contents:

```
$nrconf{override_rc} ||= {};
$nrconf{override_rc}->{qr(^nvmesh.\*\.service$)} = 0;
```
